                <h2>Welcome to Statue of Liberty</h2> <br>
                <p>
                    Statue of Liberty, formally Liberty Enlightening the World, colossal statue on Liberty Island in the
                    Upper New York Bay, U.S., commemorating the friendship of the peoples of the United States and
                    France. Standing 305 feet (93 metres) high including its pedestal, it represents a woman holding a
                    torch in her raised right hand and a tablet bearing the adoption date of the Declaration of
                    Independence (July 4, 1776) in her left. The torch, which measures 29 feet (8.8 metres) from the
                    flame tip to the bottom of the handle, is accessible via a 42-foot (12.8-metre) service ladder
                    inside the arm (this ascent was open to the public from 1886 to 1916). An elevator carries visitors
                    to the observation deck in the pedestal, which may also be reached by stairway, and a spiral
                    staircase leads to an observation platform in the figure’s crown. A plaque at the pedestal’s
                    entrance is inscribed with a sonnet, “The New Colossus” (1883) by Emma Lazarus. It was written to
                    help raise money for the pedestal, and it reads:

                    Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
                    With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
                    Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
                    A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
                    Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
                    Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
                    Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
                    The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
                    “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
                    With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,
                    Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
                    The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
                    Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
                    I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
                </p>
